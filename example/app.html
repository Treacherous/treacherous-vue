            <h1>Treacherous - Vue Examples</h1>
            <p>Here are some simple examples which show how to use treacherous with vue.</p>
            <p>Head to the examples folder in the <a href="https://github.com/grofit/treacherous-vue">source</a> to see how it all works.</p>
            <fieldset :class="{ invalid: !isBasicValid }">
                <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This shows the most basic example where you have a single component which validates a single field,
                    there is also a button to trigger validation, which covers the most basic use cases.
                </p>
                <basic id="basic-form" ref="basic" @model-state-changed="state => isBasicValid = state.isValid"></basic>
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset :class="{ invalid: !isComplexValid }">
                <h3>More Complex Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This shows how to use complex models which may have nested properties or arrays,
                    as well as the ability to validate on props. We have also enabled reactive validation
                    so as and when values change it will automatically update the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One other interesting thing in this example is that the <strong>age</strong>
                    is configured to use a custom view strategy, so that will handle the validation
                    differently to the other fields in this example, and all it takes is a single
                    attribute to swap strategy (and a custom strategy registered, seen in <strong>app.js</strong>)
                </p>
                <complex id="complex-form" ref="complex" :dummy-prop="dummyPropData" @model-state-changed="state => isComplexValid = state.isValid"></complex>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset>
                <h3>Validation Summaries</h3>
                <p>In some cases you will have multiple components on the page which have their own validation concerns, but want to display all the validation errors as a singular summary to the user.</p>
                <p>Because the validation groups come from refs, they are not available initially available until the parent has been mounted. This is why we have the <code>v-if</code> here to stop the
                    directive running until the validation groups have been setup.</p>
                <div id="validation-summary" v-if="validationSummaryGroups != null" v-validation-summary="validationSummaryGroups"></div>
            </fieldset>
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="compiled.js"></script>
    </body>
