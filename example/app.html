            <h1>Treacherous - Vue Examples</h1>
            <p>Here are some simple examples which show how to use treacherous with vue.</p>
            <p>Head to the examples folder in the <a href="https://github.com/grofit/treacherous-vue">source</a> to see how it all works.</p>
            <fieldset>
                <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This shows the most basic example where you have a single component which validates a single field,
                    there is also a button to manually trigger progmatic validation, which covers most basic use cases.
                </p>
                <basic id="basic-form" ref="basic"></basic>
                <button id="basic-submit" v-bind:class="{ valid: basicState, invalid: !basicState }" @click="validateBasic">Progmatically Validate - {{basicState ? 'Is' : 'Isnt'}} Valid</button>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset>
                <h3>More Complex Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This shows how to use complex models which may have nested properties or arrays,
                    there is also a button to manually trigger progmatic validation.
                </p>
                <complex id="complex-form" ref="complex"></complex>
                <button id="complex-submit" v-bind:class="{ valid: complexState, invalid: !complexState }" @click="validateComplex">Progmatically Validate - {{complexState ? 'Is' : 'Isnt'}} Valid</button>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset>
                <h3>Validation Summaries</h3>
                <p>In some cases you will have multiple components on the page which have their own validation concerns, but want to display all the validation errors as a singular summary to the user.</p>
                <p>Because the validation groups come from refs, they are not available initially available until the parent has been mounted. This is why we have the <code>v-if</code> here to stop the 
                    directive running until the validation groups have been setup.</p>
                <div id="complex-state-summary" v-if="validationSummaryGroups != null" v-validation-summary="validationSummaryGroups"></div>
            </fieldset>
        </div>
